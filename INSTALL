INSTALLATION GUIDE

Yadlr is written in Prolog using attributed variables and the clp(Q,R) extension.

You can compile and run using either Yap 5.1 or later of SWI-Prolog 5.6 or later.
It might be possible to compile using other Prolog implementations or versions,
but they are neither tested nor supported.

You can get Yap from http://yap.sourceforge.net/ and
SWI-Prolog from http://www.swi-prolog.org/

You need to compile with attributed variables and co-routining (see configure options
for Yap or SWI-Prolog about how to do this) and also include the clp(Q,R) package in
your Prolog installation.
